# `{{ Kelly | plus: Kelly }}`

This is a series through ShopifyDevs and hosted on YouTube and Twitch. The series goes through Shopify theme development and common online store tips &amp; tricks. With wit, comical delivery with a hint of satirical anecdotes. Really fun, entertaining and most definitely edifying when it comes to theme development and an online store. If you are just starting, like me, then this is definitely for you. If you are more seasoned, still start watching. There is a gem for everyone.

If you wanted a sort of transcription/notes to go with the vids, then you are welcome to use these materials to help in furthering your understanding of the content being presented by Kelly Vaughn, `{{ Kelly | }}`, and Thomas Kelly, `{{ | plus: Kelly }}`, in the `{{ Kelly | plus: Kelly }}` Shopify theme dev series.
